# Computational Chemical Engineering Simulator

This project is a **modular web app** that integrates key AP Chemistry topics and demonstrates chemical engineering thinking.  

**Topics Included:**
- **Kinetics:** Arrhenius equation, reaction rate, concentration vs time, optimal temperature for fastest rate.
- **Thermodynamics:** Gibbs free energy, energy cost, temperature optimization for spontaneous reactions.
- **Equilibrium:** Equilibrium constant, yield calculation, temperature for maximum yield.
- **Acids & Bases:** pH calculation, buffer safety, optimal hydrogen ion concentration.
- **Intermolecular Forces (IMFs):** Phase prediction, impact of IMFs, temperature optimization for desired phase.
